# Notochord and axial progenitors in chicken embryos and human organoids
This is a repository of scripts used to analyse single-cell transcriptomic data in [Rito et al. (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.27.530267v1).


## Data download
The raw sequencing data is publicly available to download at the [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/download.html) genomics data repository.

    *  chicken trunk embryo [data]() (4, 7, 10, 13 somites). Dissociated tissue caudal from 3rd somite. 

    *  human posterior neuruloid [data](). Day3 micropatterned colonies with several timing delays in BMP&NODAL inhibition.

    *  human notoroid [data](). Days 3, 5 and 7 trunk organoids featuring neural, paraxial and axial mesoderm.

## Chicken analyses

## Macaque analyses

## Human analyses

## interspecies comparisons
